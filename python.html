        <p style="font-size: 1.3vw; color: white;">The open-source language Python was developed by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was designed as an easy-to-use language,
            with features such as using indentation instead of brackets to group statements.
            Python is also a very compact language, designed so that complex jobs can be executed with only a few statements. In the 2010s,
            Python became one of the most popular programming languages, along with Java and JavaScript.
