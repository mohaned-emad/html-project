        <p style="font-size: 1.3vw; color: white;">The World Wide Web is a system for displaying text, graphics, and audio retrieved over the Internet on a computer monitor. 
            Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page, and such pages frequently contain “links” that allow related pages to be retrieved. 
            HTML (hypertext markup language) is the markup language for encoding Web pages. 
            It was designed by Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland during the 1980s and is defined by an SGML DTD. 
            HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables. 
            They mark up a document for display by a computer program known as a Web browser. 
            The browser interprets the tags, displaying the headings, paragraphs, 
            and tables in a layout that is adapted to the screen size and fonts available to it.</p>
